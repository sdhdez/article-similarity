A simple formula is derived to approximate the expected time per event. The formula can be used to set the parameters of the calendar queue to achieve optimal or near optimal performance. In addition, a technique is given to calibrate a specific calendar queue implementation so that the formula can be applied in a practical setting.\n",

In this paper we present an analysis of the static calendar queue which maintains N active events. A step of the discrete event simulator removes and processes the event with the smallest associated time and inserts a new event whose associated time is the time of the removed event plus a random increment with mean /spl mu/. We demonstrate that for the infinite bucket calendar queue the optimal bucket width is approximately /spl delta//sub opt/=/spl radic/(2b/c)/spl mu//N where b is the time to process an empty bucket and c the incremental time to process a list element. With bucket width chosen to be /spl delta//sub opt/, the expected time to process an event is approximately minimized at the constant c+/spl radic/(2bc)+d, where d is the fixed time to process an event. We show that choosing the number of buckets to be O(N) yields a calendar queue with performance equal to or almost equal to the performance of the infinite bucket calendar queue.\n",

Unfortunately with this type of scheme, it is difficult to ensure that the priority of the task, following the triggering event, is at the appropriate level.

      "Dynamic Calendar Queue Discrete event simulations need a priority queue sorting events according to their timestamp to process events in their time order. As the number of events increases, the choice of a data structure for this event list can affect the simulation performance significantly. A calendar queue is one of data structures popularly used in most discrete event simulators due to its O(1) time complexity regardless of the number of stored events. Calendar queues, however, perform poorly over skewed event distributions due to the static resize algorithm and the inappropriate selection of events for measuring the degree of the event distribution. To improve the calendar queue's performance over uneven event distributions, this paper proposes two new mechanisms. We call our calendar queue adopting these two mechanisms DCQ (Dynamic Calendar Queue). Our experiment results showed that DCQ can achieve an order of magnitude speed-up for uneven distributions while performing as well over even distributions as the conventional calendar queue.\n",

In contrast to the usual basis sets such as the Schur functions e\"@l(z), which are homogeneous polynomials in the z\"i, the t\"@l(z) are inhomogeneous. This property is reflected in the fact that the t\"@l(z) are a natural basis for the expansion of certain (inhomogeneous) symmetric polynomials constructed from rising factorials. This and several other properties of the t\"@l(z) are proved. Two generalizations of the t\"@l(z) are also given. The first generalizes the t\"@l(z) to a 1-parameter family of symmetric polynomials, T\"@l(@a; z), where @a is an arbitrary parameter.

      "An efficient top-down parsing algorithm for understanding speech by using stochastic syntactic and semantic models The paper is concerning an approach for understanding speech using a new form of probabilistic models to represent syntactic and semantic knowledge of a restricted domain. One important feature of our grammar is that the parse tree directly represents the semantic content of the utterance. Since we determine that semantic content by an integrated search, we avoid consistency problems at the interface between the recognizer and the language understanding part of the speech understanding system. We succeeded in designing such an incremental algorithm, which integrates semantic, syntactic, and acoustic-phonetic knowledge in a seamless, consistent way. High efficiency is achieved by using a chart-parsing technique with structure-sharing and a strict top-down strategy for opening new word hypotheses in the pronunciation layer.\n",

      "Trading conflict and capacity aliasing in conditional branch predictors As modern microprocessors employ deeper pipelines and issue multiple instructions per cycle, they are becoming increasingly dependent on accurate branch prediction. Because hardware resources for branch-predictor tables are invariably limited, it is not possible to hold all relevant branch history for all active branches at the same time, especially for large workloads consisting of multiple processes and operating-system code. The problem that results, commonly referred to as aliasing in the branch-predictor tables, is in many ways similar to the misses that occur in finite-sized hardware caches.In this paper we propose a new classification for branch aliasing based on the three-Cs model for caches, and show that conflict aliasing is a significant source of mispredictions. Unfortunately, the obvious method for removing conflicts --- adding tags and associativity to the predictor tables --- is not a cost-effective solution.To address this problem, we propose the skewed branch predictor, a multi-bank, tag-less branch predictor, designed specifically to reduce the impact of conflict aliasing. Through both analytical and simulation models, we show that the skewed branch predictor removes a substantial portion of conflict aliasing by introducing redundancy to the branch-predictor tables. Although this redundancy increases capacity aliasing compared to a standard one-bank structure of comparable size, our simulations show that the reduction in conflict aliasing overcomes this effect to yield a gain in prediction accuracy. Alternatively, we show that a skewed organization can achieve the same prediction accuracy as a standard one-bank organization but with half the storage requirements.\n",

This is accomplished by trading the cost of a mispredicted branch forexecution of both paths following the conditional branch.In this paper we examine two enhancements for branch prediction in the presence of predicated code. Both of the techniques use recently calculated predicate definitions to provide a more intelligent branch prediction. The first branch predictor, called the Squash False Path Filter, recognizes fetched branches known to be guarded with a false predicate and predicts them as not-taken with 100% accuracy. The second technique, called the Predicate Global Update branch predictor, improves prediction by incorporating recent predicate information into the branch predictor. We use these techniques to aid the prediction of region-based branches. A region-based branch is a branch that is left in a predicated region of code. A region-based branch may be correlated with predicate definitions in the region in addition to those that define the branch's guarding predicate.\n",

Cases where task execution times are deterministic and others in which execution times are random variables are analyzed.

The architecture is based on a farm of Web servers managed by a content-aware load balancer that differentiates the service required by the workload and implements a control admission under extreme overload. The results show that the burstiness in the workload has to be controlled on the Web servers in order to obtain the best response in terms of performance and overhead.\n",

      "Load balancing for clustered web farms We propose a scheme which attempts to optimally balance the load on the servers of a clustered web farm. Solving this performance problem is crucial to achieving minimal average response time for customer requests, and thus ultimately to achieving maximal customer throughput. This short paper gives an overview of three new mathematical contributions. First, we describe a goal setting algorithm to determine the load on each server which minimizes the average customer request response time given the possibly overlapping cluster assignments of sites to servers and the current customer request load for each site. The cluster assignments, which of necessity can only be changed relatively infrequently, have a major effect on the optimal response time in the goal setting component. So, second, we describe a static algorithm which determines good assignments of sites to servers. Third, and finally, we describe a dynamic algorithm which handles the real-time server load balancing, reacting to the fluctuating customer request load in order to come as close as possible to achieving the idealized optimal average response time. We examine the performance of the overall load balancing scheme via simulation experiments.\n",

No software for the WCS option is provided by the manufacturer. Since many microprograms contain errors which announce themselves only by causing the system to crash, and since the microprogrammer can access registers which are invisible to AL programmers, it is difficult to locate errors in microprograms. The micro-debugger is a set of ALGOL, Assembly Language and microcode routines which can ease the task of testing microprograms. It is a major modification of the MSU microassembler which allows setting of micro-breakpoints, display of all registers which are available to the microprogrammer, and interactive modification of these registers and core memory locations. It can be used with the standard symbolic debugger supplied by Data General to provide a powerful tool for checking and testing microprograms.\n",

These systems are costly and complex to design and operate, yet little exists in the way of analytical methodologies for them. We present a decision support framework based on defining relevant system performance metrics, traffic analysis reporting, as well as discrete event simulation modeling. We have used this approach to analyze numerous pneumatic tubes systems in the United States and present a representative case study from a large tertiary care hospital.

      "QMSim Summary: QMSim was designed to simulate large-scale genotyping data in multiple and complex livestock pedigrees. The simulation is basically carried out in two steps. In the first step, a historical population is simulated to establish mutation-drift equilibrium, and in the second step, recent population structures are generated, which can be very complex. A wide variety of genome architectures, ranging from infinitesimal model to single-locus model, can be simulated. The program is efficient in terms of computing time and memory requirements. Availability: Executable versions of QMSim for Windows and Linux are freely available at http://www.aps.uoguelph.ca/~msargol/qmsim/. Contact: msargol@uoguelph.ca\n",

      "Intersection number and topology preservation within digital surfaces In this paper, we prove a new result of digital topology which states that the digital fundamental groupa notion previously introduced by Kong (Comput. Graphics 13 (1989) 159-166)is sufficient to characterize topology preservation within digital surfaces. This proof involves a new tool for proving theorems in this field: the intersection number which counts the number of real intersections between two surfels loops lying on a digital surface. The main property of the intersection number and the reason why it is useful is the following: the intersection number between two paths does not change after any continuous deformation applied to the paths.\n",

      "Intersection Number of Paths Lying on a Digital Surface and a New Jordan Theorem The purpose of this paper is to define the notion of \"real\" intersection between paths drawn on the 3d digital boundary of a connected object. We consider two kinds of paths for different adjacencies, and define the algebraic number of oriented intersections between these two paths. We show that this intersection number is invariant under any homotopic transformation we apply on the two paths. Already, this intersection number allows us to prove a Jordan curve theorem for some surfels curves which lie on a digital surface, and appears as a good tool for proving theorems in digital topology about surfaces.\n",
